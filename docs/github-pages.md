# GitHub Pages

In order to publish documentation to GitHub Pages, the following do the following:

## .vitepress Folder

This folder contains GitHub Pages site configuration, typically stored in the ```config.mjs``` file.
## public Folder

This folder contains everything you can reference from your GitHub Pages site. The content of this foder will be copied to the root folder of the site. For this repository we keep assets like logos in the ```assets``` subfolder. See [Asset Handling](https://vitepress.dev/guide/asset-handling#the-public-directory) for more information.
