# Emoji

It is possible to use emoji in pages built with VitePress, but it depends on the place where emojis are used: in regular Markdown or in site configuration.

## Regular Markdown Files

Refer to [VitePress Documentation](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown#emoji).

## `index.md` File

The `Ã¬ndex.md` file resembles a YAML file more than a markdown file, and encoding emojis like describen above is not possible. Instead, emoji symbold must be typed directly.

::: tip
On Windows you can use insert emojis by pressing `Windows` + `.` (period) key combination to open emoji panel. On Mac press `Control` + `Command` + `Space` key combination.
